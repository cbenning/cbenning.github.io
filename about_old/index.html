  <p>
  Chris is a Linux software developer at <a href="http://www.sophos.com/en-us/threat-center/threat-analyses.aspx">Sophos Labs</a> in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 

  If he's not trying out a new programming language, messing with the Linux kernel, or fiddling with config files, you can probably find him hiking or playing his guitar.
