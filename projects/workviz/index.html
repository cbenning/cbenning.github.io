<h2>Description</h2>
Workviz is a prototype tool for viewing live server metadata in a compact way. The original intention was not to create an admin tool but rather a way for human's to use their natural pattern recognition to identify properties in a server cluster.

Written in python, using NumPy and VPython, Workviz displays a 3d representation of user-selected metrics about any number of physical machines. It also supports simulations by creating alternate "Workload Generators" and inserting them on the fly. Currently there are two workload generators built-in:
<ol>
	<li>one which consumes data from a script (Used for real-time server data)</li>
	<li>another which uses a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">Normal Distribution</a> to generate fake data.</li>
</ol>
