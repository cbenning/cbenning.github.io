  </section>

  Over the years I have been experimenting with countless methods for keeping my files available to me wherever I am. Being primarily a linux user, I have a great opportunity to experiment given some of the clever tools that have emerged. I have been hard-pressed to find a solution to meet my exact requirements but I have actually settled upon a solution that has withstood the test of time and I want to share it.<!--more-->

I will mention that simple remote login does not meet my requirements for serious work. It does however supplement my setup as an alternative access method if I don't trust the machine I am on. If you are looking for a remote access tool, I highly recommend <a href="http://freenx.berlios.de/">freenx</a>.

One other requirement I should mention is that I need to keep my stuff backed up. I need to make sure I don't lose anything that I decide I need to keep. Because of the iterative nature of the stuff I work on, having the opportunity to roll back to a previous backup is a huge bonus and has proven extremely valuable in the past.

I realize that a combination of various web-services offered for free such as <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">Evernote</a>, <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a>, etc. can probably meet most people's needs. I do see some issues with current web-services that I prefer not to have to deal with:
<ol>
	<li>Ownership - Once you have uploaded something, can you be sure It belongs to you?</li>
	<li>Availability - Many web-services up-times are awesome, but even the mighty Google goes down from time to time</li>
	<li>Backups - Do you know if your stuff is actually being backed up? Even if it is, do you have access to the backups?</li>
	<li>Instability - Many of the cool new stuff that comes out has the potential to die after their initial popularity has died off.</li>
</ol>
By hosting my own private solution, I at least know that If the internet in my neighborhood goes down I can go home and a copy of my backups and all my files are available on my home server.

My solution consists of the following components:
<h3>Unison &amp; SSH</h3>
<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/">Unison</a> is a file synchronization tool which is designed for synchronization between two machines. It allows you to synchronize folders on separate machines over a network (using SSH) = and it even runs on the big three: Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. This means that you can use it for all your machines. If you only have two machines then this is a dead simple setup. More than two machines, is basically the same just more pairs. In my setup:
<ul>
	<li>My laptop has my entire home directory (minus some annoying configuration stuff)</li>
	<li>My work machine has only certain files and folders within my home directory which are related to work</li>
	<li>My home server has the entire thing</li>
	<li>And if I need to access files from an untrusted machine, ssh or freenx lets me get at them quickly</li>
</ul>
Each machine has unison installed but only the ones that can initiate a synchronization need their own config file. Here is and example config file (.unison/default.prf)
<pre>root = local_directory   // I use my home directory here
root = ssh://remote_username@remote_host:port/remote_directory

//Explicit commands to backup specific things
path = folder_to_include     //Relative to local_directory

//You can also do a "Sync everything Except" approach as below
ignore = Path {.*}    // Ignore config files,
ignore = Path {bin}   // Ignore my binary files</pre>
The only issue I have encountered is that in order for everything to work, you have to run a sync now and then. Occasional sync's are completely habit now though so it's not really a problem. If you do forget to sync, you can always log in to the machine and do a sync via ssh because unison has a commanline version built in!
<h3>BackupPC</h3>
I encountered <a href="http://backuppc.sourceforge.net/">BackupPC</a> a few years ago when I was doing admin work and was looking for a good, cheap backup solution for one of our clients. I tested the software int he office (along with many others) and I can honestly say it is impressive. Whether you are a company or an individual, this thing rocks. It can be a bit of a challenge to get working perfectly, but once it does it works very well. You could definitely get a good setup using just a cronjob that does a clever copy too if you wanted to research that.

Anyway, BackupPC does tons of stuff but the feature I am interested in, is that it does very clever incremental backups that take up very little space depending on how many files you modify between backups.

In my configuration, BackupPC will do nightly incremental backups up my home directory located on the home server to an external drive.

Note: BackupPC sometimes requires some trickery if you are storing archives on a separate volume than the one it is running on. (hint, mount the external volume to the default location as opposed to changing the location in the configuration)

If you have some questions on configurations, leave a comment or fire me an email. Also here is my uber-simple setup in diagram form:

I am also considering an attempt to port Unison to android so I can access and backup stuff on my phone!
