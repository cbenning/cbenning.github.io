Chris is a Security Developer at <a href="http://www.shadownetworks.com">Shadow Networks Canada</a> in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. 

  If he's not trying out a new programming language, working on a side project or trying to automate something, you can probably find him hiking or learning about amateur photography.
