This information assumes you have already setup fun_plug on your DNS-320L NAS as per <a href="http://nas-tweaks.net/371/hdd-installation-of-the-fun_plug-0-7-on-nas-devices/"> these instructions</a>. I started by following the following instructions which I found <a href="http://forum.bittorrent.com/topic/19278-sync-to-nas-d-link-dns-320/">here</a>.

{% highlight bash %}
cd /ffp/start/
wget http://btsync.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/btsync_arm.tar.gz
tar zxvf btsync_arm.tar.gz
{% endhighlight %}

Once extracted, I tested it by running:

{% highlight bash %}
chmod x btsync
./btsync
{% endhighlight %}

And then accessing *my-nas-ip*:8888 in my browser. The issue I keep seeing people encounter is that they cannot select outside of their '/ffp' folder. This is because the bash shell that funplug starts is run inside a chroot at '/ffp'. However, when you go to select a folder, the root of the filesystem is still in '/mnt'. In my case it is '/mnt/HD/HD_a2/'. It's a simple hurdle, so hopefully this saves a few people a little time.

Once it's working, make it start automatically by adding something like this to your '/mnt/HD/HD_a2/ffp/fun_plug' file:

{% highlight bash %}
chmod a+x /ffp/start/btsync
/ffp/start/./btsync
{% endhighlight %}

Happy syncing!
