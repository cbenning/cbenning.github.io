Workviz is a prototype tool I built for viewing live server metadata in a compact way. The original intention was not to create an admin tool but rather a way for human's to use their natural pattern recognition to identify properties in a server cluster. Written in python, using <em>NumPy</em> and <em>VPython</em>, Workviz displays a 3d representation of user-selected metrics about any number of physical machines. It also supports simulations by creating alternate "Workload Generators" and inserting them on the fly.
