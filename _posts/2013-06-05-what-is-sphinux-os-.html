Today I stumbled across a <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTM4NDI">Phoronix article</a> talking about something called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sphinux/">SphinUX OS</a>, an Egyptian-made OS with a custom kernel based on the LSX Unix architecture that made outrageous claims about performance and security. With comments like "", I couldn't resist firing it up in a VM.     VM Setup Name: Whatever Type: Other Version: Other/Unknown Disable network card connection Booted Type: Linux Type Linux 2.6 64   Funny boot sound
