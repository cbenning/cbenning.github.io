</a>This is most likely common knowledge but I keep forgetting how to do it. If you want to run shell command on a small section of text in file you have open in vim, here is how. 
<!--more-->
In visual-mode, select the text.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.benninger.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-81" style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" title="Screenshot" src="http://www.benninger.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot.png" alt="" width="490" height="308" /></a></p>
&nbsp;
<div>Now hit : and you should see :'&lt;, '&gt; at the prompt</div>
&nbsp;
<div><a href="http://www.benninger.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-83" title="Screenshot-1" src="http://www.benninger.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-1.png" alt="" width="494" height="305" /></a></div>
&nbsp;
<div>Now following that, type :w !&lt;command&gt;, where &lt;command&gt; is the command you want to run. In my case I wanted to see how many characters were in the selected text, so I used 'wc -w'. Then hit enter.</div>
&nbsp;
<div><a href="http://www.benninger.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84" title="Screenshot-2" src="http://www.benninger.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-2.png" alt="" width="491" height="306" /></a></div>
&nbsp;
<div>The result should show itself in the output section. In my case, there were 22 words.</div>
&nbsp;
<div><a href="http://www.benninger.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-85" title="Screenshot-3" src="http://www.benninger.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screenshot-3.png" alt="" width="493" height="332" /></a></div>
&nbsp;
<div>Happy Viming!</div>
