I was listening to one of my <a href="http://linuxoutlaws.com/">favorite podcasts</a> today when the topic of the <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story/24056/Attachmate_Buys_Novell">Attachmate acquisition of Novell</a> came up. I had heard about this a while ago but decided to go take a look at Attachmate website because I hadn't heard of the company before. I often like take a look at where large companies have offices (if any) within Canada simply because I am always in the market. There were a surprisingly large number of offices in Canada, nearly one in each province. I<a href="http://www.attachmate.com/Worldwide/Canada+Offices.htm"> then noticed the addresses</a> and thought it was amusing enough to share them.

Apparently the Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba offices are in Ontario, and the British Columbia office is in Seattle,WA. Way to up-talk your geographical distribution Attachmate.

<em>Fun fact: The distance from Alberta to Markham, Ontario is roughly the distance from Sweden to Turkey, must be a helluva commute for those Alberta office workers.</em>
