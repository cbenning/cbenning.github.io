Decided I wanted to try out the new <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/California">California</a> calendar application from the Yorba folks. Sometimes it can be hard to find ever dev library you need on your platform so I thought I'd write up which packages I needed to install.

<br/>First pull down the source from either their git repo or from <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/California">here</a>

Then install the following packages on your debian jessie:

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libgee-0.8-dev libecal1.2-dev libsoup2.4-dev libgdata-dev libgoa-1.0-dev libgirepository1.0-dev itstool valac
{% endhighlight %}

Now just follow the instructions in the INSTALL file:

{% highlight bash %}
./configure
make
{% endhighlight %}

For easy usage you can make a .desktop file with something like this(/home/username/.local/share/applications/california.desktop):

{% highlight bash %}
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Icon=/usr/share/icons/gnome/48x48/mimetypes/x-office-calendar.png
Exec=/path-to-california/california-0.2.0/src/california
Name=California
Comment=California
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can just find it in your menu, or in Gnome just hit the 'Super' key and type California.
