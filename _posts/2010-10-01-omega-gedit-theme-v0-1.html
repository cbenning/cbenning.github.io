Omega is a <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">Gedit</a> theme I have slowly been making by modifying the built-in Oblivion theme to my liking. A few colleagues started using it and I decided to post it. I have been making changes slowly over time when I find something unpleasant to the eye. Eclipse version also in the works… but If you like darker gedit themes..check it out.
