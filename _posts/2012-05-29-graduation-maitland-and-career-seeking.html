Well it's done, I am finished all the requirements for my MSc. and have now been approved for graduation. \
<br /><br/>

My thesis, entitled <em>Maitland: Analysis of Packed and Encrypted Malware via Paravirtualization Extensions</em>Â can be found <a href="http://www.benninger.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Benninger_Christopher_MSc_2012.pdf">here</a> if anyone is interested. In addition, a few months ago we began working on a conference paper version of my thesis work. It was recently accepted to the IEEE Cloud 2012 conference and I am very excited about it. I will post some paper details and a citation once the conference is over (late June).
<br /><br/>

Now that my MSc. is finished, I'll be investigating some career opportunities both here in Vancouver and abroad.
