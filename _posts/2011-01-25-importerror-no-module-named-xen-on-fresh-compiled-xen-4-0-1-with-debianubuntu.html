This took me a few hours to find in the mailing list and I thought I would share it with a title that people would find if googling for a solution.<!--more-->

I compiled a fresh copy of Xen 4.0.1 and all of the tools that come along with it. I immediately rebooted and tried to run "xm" to check the status of the system. Any variation on any xen-related command led to me something along the lines of this:
<pre class="brush: shell">ImportError: No module named xen.xm</pre>
The cause is that xen installs all of the python tools into ﻿﻿"/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/" which is not by default in pythons path on a Debian (or Ubuntu) machine. After several hours of searching I found <a href="http://lists.xensource.com/archives/html/xen-users/2010-05/msg00820.html">this</a> post describing the solution.

When installing the compiled tools, use this obscure option to the makefile:
<pre class="brush: shell">make install-tools PYTHON_PREFIX_ARG="--install-layout=deb"</pre>
Enjoy
