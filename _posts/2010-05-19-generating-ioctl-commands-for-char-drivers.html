In a project of mine, I noticed that passing the specific integer '2' as a command to a device driver I was working on caused it to return -1 without even entering my ioctl_handle function or giving a reason. After doing a bit of reading I learned that these command numbers are shared across the system and you can get some weird behavior using the same numbers for different drivers.
<br /><br />
Being in a hurry, I chose an arbitrary integer above 200 as an offset for all my commands knowing in the back of my mind that I'd need to find the 'proper' solution. Now that I have some spare time, I google'd around a bit and found there are some macros for just this purpose:
{% highlight c %}
_IO(int type, int number)
{% endhighlight %}
_IO is used for generating a simple command integer that needs to define a command and (optionally) get an integer return value. <em>int type</em> is an arbitrarily chosen number unique to this device driver. <em>int number</em> is the number you wish to assign to the command (often in a range beginning with 0 or 1). 
<br /><br />
A simple example using this macro is as follows:
{% highlight c %}
#define MYDRIVER_IOCTL_TYPE 124  /* My arbitrary number */
#define MYDRIVER_CMDONE _IO(MYDRIVER_IOCTL_TYPE, 1)  /* Command one */
#define MYDRIVER_CMDTWO _IO(MYDRIVER_IOCTL_TYPE, 2)  /* Command two */
{% endhighlight %}

There are three more that are similar but used if you are generating a command that will be passing a pointer to a data-structure in the call to IOCTL in user-space. 
{% highlight c %}
_IOR(int type, int number, data_type)
_IOW(int type, int number, data_type)
_IORW(int type, int number, data_type)
{% endhighlight %}
Each takes a third parameter <em>data_type</em> which is the data-structure type that you intend to send/receive. _IOR for example is used if you intend to have the kernel code fill your struct with some data, hence the notion of a READ. _IOW and _IORW are similar but for writing and read/writing respectively.
