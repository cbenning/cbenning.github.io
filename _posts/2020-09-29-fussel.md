# Fussel Gallery

I've been working to scratch a personal itch for months. The goal was to find a tool to:

 * Display photos
 * Separate photos by face-tags
 * Provide a unique URL per face-tagged person
 * Require absolutely no backend running code (I don't need another thing to maintain)

I spent months searching and found nothing. So I wrote my own tool [Fussel](https://github.com/cbenning/fussel)
