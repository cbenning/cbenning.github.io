Omega is (originally) a Gedit theme I made by modifying the built-in Oblivion theme to my liking. A few colleagues started using it and I decided to post it. I have been making changes slowly over time when I find something unpleasant to the eye. Gedit Download: omega_v0.1.tar.gz Recommended Font: Terminus Installation: Unpack the tarfile, put the omega.xml file in ~/.gnome2/gedit/styles/ and restart Gedit if necessary Screenshot: Eclipse (update!) Thanks to Matthew Imrie for creating an Eclipse version of my omega theme. Download and installation instructions can be found here.
